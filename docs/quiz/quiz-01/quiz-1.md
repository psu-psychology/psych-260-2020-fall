1. The image illustrates what type of slice?</br> 
**A. Sagittal.**</br> 
B. Dorsal. (not a type of slice)</br> 
C. Coronal.(slices are symmetric)</br> 
D. Axial. (slices are symmetric)</br> 

2. All of the following structures can be seen in the figure EXCEPT</br> 
A. White matter.</br>
B. Gray matter.</br>
C. **Lateral ventricles**. (CSF would appear dark; often hard to see in lateral view)</br> 
D. Cerebral cortex.</br>

3. The figure illustrates the use of \_\_\_ magnetic resonance imaging, a technique with \_\_\_ spatial resolution.</br>
A. functional; fair (∼ 3+ mm). (low spatial resolution, often depicted with color-coded activity maps)</br>
B. **structural; good (∼ 1 mm)**. </br>
C. neural; excellent (∼ 1 micron). (not a type of MRI)</br>
D. diffusion tensor; poor (∼ 1 cm) (fiber pathways not shown).</br>

4. This structure in the midbrain was where Descartes believed the soul influenced movements of the body.</br>
A. superior colliculus. (in midbrain, but not part of Descartes' thinking)</br>
B. pons. (not in midbrain.)</br>
C. amygdala. (not in midbrain.)</br>
D. **pineal gland**.</br>

5. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are detected using...</br>
A. positron emission tomography (PET); local metabolic rates. (ERPs ≠ PET)</br>
B. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); the integrity of white matter fiber tracts. (MRI ≠PET)</br>
C. **electroencephalography (EEG); the time-locked electrical activity of large numbers of neurons**.</br>
D. magnetoencephalography (MEG); average brain magnetic activity. (ERPs usually measure electrical activity)</br>

6. In the cerebral cortex, the lateral fissure is \_\_\_ to the longitudinal fissure.</br> 
A. posterior. (longitudinal and lateral fissures are roughly parallel to rostral/caudal axis)</br>
B. anterior. (longitudinal and lateral fissures are roughly parallel to rostral/caudal axis)</br>
C. rostral. (longitudinal and lateral fissures are roughly parallel to rostral/caudal axis)</br>
D. **inferior**.</br>

7. The space between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater of the meninges is filled with a fluid substance called \_\_\_.</br>
A. brain plasma. (incorrect term)</br>
B. interstitial fluid. (possible answer, but there's a better, more precise one)</br>
C. **cerebro-spinal fluid**.</br>
D. cerebellar-spacing flux. (made-up term)</br>

8. All of these structures are components of the midbrain EXCEPT: </br>
A. superior colliculus.</br>
B. **3rd ventricle**. (associated with diencephalon) </br>
C. tegmentum.</br>
D. inferior colliculus.</br>

9. Why does fMRI represent an *indirect* measure of brain activity?</br>
A. It measures brain structure, not function. (not *f*MRI)</br>
B. It measures electrical activity, but neurons send chemical messages. (sounds like EEG.)</br>
C. **It measures changes in blood oxygen and blood flow that follow neural activity**.</br>
D. It has poor spatial resolution. (true, but not why it is an indirect measure)</br>

10. Anterograde and retrograde histochemical cell tracers help neuroscientists determine \_\_\_. </br>
A. what stimuli best activate a brain region. (structural vs. functional methods)</br>
B. **what connects where**.</br>
C. when to stimulate a brain region for maximum effect. (structural vs. functional methods)</br>
D. whether a brain area is functioning normally. (structural vs. functional methods)</br>

BONUS QUESTIONS

11. This forebrain structure in the ventral diencephalon controls both the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system.</br>
A. Hippocampus. (not in diencephalon; associated with semantic memory)</br>
B. Thalamus. (in diencephalon, but not with ANS)</br>
C. Medulla. (in hindbrain, not diencephalon)</br>
D. **Hypothalamus**.</br>

12. The arrow in Figure 1 points to a fissure in the cerebral cortex called the \_\_\_.</br>
A. **lateral fissure**.</br>
B. superior longitudinal fissure. (not visible from this sagittal view)</br>
C. calcarine fissure. (in occipital lobe; not emphasized in this course)</br>
D. Rolandic fissure. (less common name for central sulcus)</br>
